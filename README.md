This project is based on the Lie Detection with Text and Image topic from Klika's final year undergraduate thesis at Taylor's University. It explores multimodal deception detection by integrating video, audio, and text data. The goal is to investigate the potential of deep learning models to identify deception from courtroom trial videos.

Due to data privacy and licensing restrictions, the dataset used in this project—sourced from the University of Michigan’s public courtroom verdict database—cannot be publicly shared.

All data preprocessing and model training scripts were independently written by Klika during the project development phase. AI tools, particularly ChatGPT, were used to assist in writing code comments and improving documentation. Every part of the implementation reflects an understanding of deep learning workflows, data handling, and multimodal fusion techniques.


  Note:
  This repository only includes a portion of the codebase to respect the contributions of other team members involved in the broader group project. Additionally, due to the limited size of the dataset, the models are susceptible to overfitting, and results should be interpreted cautiously.
